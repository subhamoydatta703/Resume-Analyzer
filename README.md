# Resume Analyzer

A high-performance, asynchronous resume analysis and evaluation platform. The project is built with **Bun**, **Express 5**, **Prisma (PostgreSQL)**, **Redis (BullMQ & Caching)**, **Clerk Authentication**, and **React 19 + Vite**.

Users upload PDF resumes, which are parsed and enqueued for asynchronous processing. A background worker evaluates the resumes against a structured JSON schema using the **Google Gemini API**, providing overall scoring, ATS evaluation, suggested roles, strengths, areas of improvement, and contact details in a premium, responsive dark-themed dashboard.

---

## Key Features

- **Clerk Authentication & Sync**: Seamless authentication flow on the frontend. The backend synchronizes user profile events (upsert/delete) asynchronously via **Clerk Webhooks** validated with secure **Svix** signatures.
- **Asynchronous Analysis Pipeline**: Resume uploads are fast and responsive; actual processing runs in a background thread managed via a **BullMQ** task queue and a Redis broker.
- **AI-Driven Evaluation**: Powered by the **Google Gemini API** (`@google/genai` SDK) to parse raw text and return structured JSON reports mapping score analytics and qualitative recommendations.
- **Cache-First Results**: Completed analyses are cached inside **Redis** for fast fetching.
- **Responsive Workspace Dashboard**: High-fidelity dashboard designed using **Tailwind CSS v3** featuring theme toggling (Light/Dark), upload progress bars, and tabbed score cards.
- **Universal Containerization**: Fully dockerized environment with multi-stage builds and a unified `docker-compose.yml` config.

## Getting Started

### Option A: Local Development Setup

To run the application locally outside of Docker, you will need **Bun 1.x**, a running **PostgreSQL** instance, and a **Redis** instance.

#### 1. Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install local dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```
3. Configure environment variables. Create a `backend/.env` file:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/resume_db?sslmode=disable"
   WORKER_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/resume_db?sslmode=disable"
   REDIS_HOST="localhost"
   REDIS_PORT=6379
   GEMINI_API_KEY="your_google_gemini_api_key"
   FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000"
   CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_..."
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."
   CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_..."
   PORT=5000
   ```
4. Generate the database client and apply the schema:
   ```bash
   bun run db:push
   ```
5. Start the backend API:
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```
6. In a new terminal tab, start the background worker:
   ```bash
   bun run src/services/workerService.ts
   ```

#### 2. Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```
3. Create a `frontend/.env` file:
   ```env
   VITE_API_URL="http://localhost:5000"
   VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_..."
   ```
4. Start the frontend client dev server:
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

---

### Option B: Docker Compose Setup (Single Command)

You can run the entire ecosystem (Redis, PostgreSQL/External, API Server, Task Worker, and Frontend Client) using Docker Compose.

1. Ensure your backend environment variables are defined in `./backend/.env`. If you want to use the local Redis server container run by compose, make sure `REDIS_HOST` is set to `redis` and `REDIS_PORT` is set to `6379` inside `./backend/.env`.
2. Configure frontend variables in `./frontend/.env` (or let compose fall back to defaults).
3. Start all services:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```
4. Access the applications:
   - **Frontend UI Client**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - **API Server Endpoint**: [http://localhost:5000/health](http://localhost:5000/health)

> [!NOTE]
> The Docker Compose configuration mounts a shared named volume `uploads_data` at `/usr/src/app/public/data/uploads` inside both the `api` (Express server) and `worker` (BullMQ worker) containers. This shared volume ensures that the background worker can read the PDF files uploaded by the API container.

## API Documentation Summary

| Route | Method | Authorization | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/health` | `GET` | Public | Diagnoses connection health for the API and Database. |
| `/api/resume/upload` | `POST` | Bearer Token | Accepts PDF file uploads via form data. Stores record as `PENDING`. |
| `/api/analyze/:id` | `POST` | Bearer Token | Queues the resume ID for async processing. Returns `202 Accepted`. |
| `/api/analyze/:id` | `GET` | Bearer Token | Retrieves processing status or the finished JSON analysis payload. |
| `/api/webhooks/clerk` | `POST` | Svix Signature | Handles Clerk user lifecycle updates to create or delete sync users. |

---

## Notes & Exclusions

- **PDF Storage & Shared Volume**: Uploaded files are saved to `backend/public/data/uploads/`. In local development environments, files are ignored from Git commits. In Docker environments, this folder is backed by a shared volume so that both the API and worker containers access the exact same directory.
- **Re-upload Cleanup**: If a user uploads a duplicate resume (same name and owner), the API deletes the previous version of the file from disk using `fs.unlink` to free space, updates the DB record with the new file path, resets the parsing state (`status: "PENDING"`), and resets the analysis field (`analysisResult: Prisma.DbNull`) to prevent displaying stale results.
- **Cache Invalidation**: Analysis results are cached in Redis. When database updates occur or fresh analyses are completed, the corresponding entries are overwritten.
